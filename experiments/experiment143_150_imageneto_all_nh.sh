# Tags description:
# (ResolutionResized) - Resized resolution
# (ElyxTestNoGt) - During test, all the early exit criteria
#   are used, except the correctness one.
#   The motivation to exclude the correctness criterion is that
#   the test partition should assess how well the model generalizes
#   to unseen cases. Using the correctness criterion to select an
#   early exit (possible the last one) implies in having the
#   ground truth for unseen cases, thus making it no longer
#   an unseen case. 
# (ElyxTest) - At inference time the early exits can be used
#   to decrease the latency and resource usage. 
# (Elyx2Reg) - During training, the network is regularized
#   by early exits V2.
# (ElyxTrainAll) - During training, the early exit loss
#   is computed, but the whole network is trained.
# (TestBatch1) - Test batch has size one so each individual
#   output entropy can be assessed and recorded.
# (BackboneFrozen) - The backbone is frozen during fine-tuning,
#   where only the early exits and the final classification
#   head are trained.

# Here the resnet50 will be trained
# on MNIST to predict ambiguous images from MNIST


# For some reason the script for multiple experiments (e.g. with/without Early exits)
# never runs the last experiment. So this is a workaround to run the last experiment.
